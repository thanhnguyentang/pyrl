# pyrl

The aim of this repos is to as efficiently and quickly as possible establish knowledge and experimental setup to work in my ICML20 paper in Robust RL.  

# Some philosophy for doing this efficently and quickly: 
* Do not invent the wheel 
* Take an advantage of available resources. If it takes too much time to write a tutorial, maybe this is not a good time to do so and just read other people's tutorial. 
* Keep the experimental setup minimal.  
* Do not need to write code from scratch. Better to take on some simple implementation first to quick test of ideas. 

## Basic knowledge
